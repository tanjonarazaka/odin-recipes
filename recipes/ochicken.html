        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Orange chicken is a popular item at Chinese restaurants.
            It consists of small cubes of chicken that are breaded,
            pan-fried, and coated in an orange sauce.
        </p>

        <p>
            The orange sauce is sweet with a little tang and a hint
            of spice. It's mainly known for its orange flavor
            (as you can guess from the name). It's typically made
            with orange juice and orange zest to achieve the citrus flavor.

        <ol class="steps-li">
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

            <li>
                Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and orange
                juice for sauce into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in
                brown sugar, green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and pepper
                flakes; bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and cool for 10 to
                15 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in 1 cup cooled
                sauce. Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
                Reserve the remaining sauce.
            </li>

            <li>
                Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of
                seasoned flour. Seal the bag and shake to coat.
            </li>

            <li>
                Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
                Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned on both sides.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and cover with aluminum
                foil. Wipe out the skillet.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil
                over medium-high heat. Mix together cornstarch and water
                until completely smooth. Stir into the boiling sauce.
            </li>

            <li>
                Reduce heat to medium-low, add the chicken, and simmer,
                stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Serve over rice and enjoy!
